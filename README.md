# Predicting-Survival-of-Patients-with-Hepatitis-Data-Analysis-R
1  Motivation

Chronic infection with the Hepatitis B virus causes the inflammation of the liver, which is known as Hepatitis. The liver is an essential organ and if the liver is inflamed or damaged, it can lose its ability to function and may even cause death. It has not been possible to fully define the relative contribution of virological parameters to the progression of this disease.  Many studies have investigated the factors that can cause Hepatitis. The purpose of this project was to apply different predictive models based on health factors and lab-test results to predict whether an HBV patient would stay alive or die.

2	 Source of the data

The dataset I applied for this project is the hepatitis data set that was donated by G. Gong, Carnegie-Mellon University, via Bojan Cestnik of Jozef Stefan Institute. It is publicly available in UCI, machine learning repository. <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/hepatitis>[1]

3  Details of the dataset

the dataset consists of 19 features and 1 Class (outcome).
I analyzed this dataset by applying several classification models. This repo contains these codes:

Regression | LDA | KNN | Random Forest | SVM Linear | SVM Radial

Which I screipted by CARET package in R
